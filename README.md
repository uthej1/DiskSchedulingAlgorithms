# DiskSchedulingAlgorithms

Client-server application for disk scheduling algorithms.<br>
This application supports 6 disk scheduling algorithms.<br>
1.First Come First Serve<br>
2.Shortest Seek Time First<br>
3.SCAN<br>
4.CSCAN<br>
5.LOOK<br>
6.CLOOK<br>

# How this works?<br>
At the Client-side:<br>
Cient has to enter the head starting position, last track no., type of algorithms and the disk requests<br>
At the Server-side:<br>
According to the type of algorithm, the order of evaluation is calculated and the graph is plotted.

# What packages/ Modules did we use?
Python: Socket, Matplotlib <br>
Java: Java.net, JavaFX
